# mod 0 success
Planning time and sticking to said plan has proven to be a challenge for me. My FT job is extremely unpredictable, and I am learning quickly that setting and maintaining boundaries is the most important. 
To ensure success, I will: 
* get a point of contact for my team during unavailable hours. 
* inform my team when I am unreachable, and direct them to the POC. 
* remember that not every problem that arises is mine to solve. 

### Giving myself grace
I am a quick learner, and haven't been uncomfortable in developing a new skill set in quite some time. 
Allowing myself the space and acceptance to make mistakes is something I will have to work on. Work with my therapist
and obtaining best practices and implementing those is **_essential_** to my success. 

### *Understanding Git*
I am having the hardest time understanding the concept of Git. I don't by any means expect to be an expert, but, without understanding even the basics, 
I am realizing I am getting frustrated, and not allowing myself the grace to make mistakes. The order of using `git status`, `git add <filename>`, `git commit`,
and more so the order of which we would do these steps. I plan to spend time re-watching the lesson (again), and seeing if there is a better way for me to 
organize my notes. 
```
On branch main
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git restore --staged <file>..." to unstage)
	modified:   thoughts.md
  ```
  Namely, this section. It is extremely hard for me to understand the commitment section of it.
  To ensure success: 
  1. Follow my own rules and give myself the grace I am asking for. 
  2. Ask for help. This is hard for me, especially once a session is over. 
  3. Stick to my calendar, and utilize POM breaks. 
  4. Google is my friend!
